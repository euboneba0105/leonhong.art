## Decap CMS (Netlify CMS) config
## Backend: git-gateway
## To enable login and Git-based editing:
## 1. Deploy this site to Netlify (or another host supporting Git Gateway).
## 2. In Netlify site settings -> Identity: Enable "Identity".
## 3. In Identity -> Services: enable "Git Gateway" and connect to your repo.
## 4. Invite users or allow signup; users can then sign in via Netlify Identity.
## 5. admin/index.html in this repo loads the Netlify Identity widget.

# Notes:
# - If you prefer a different auth backend, replace `git-gateway` with an
#   appropriate backend and update `admin/index.html` accordingly.
# - For local testing, consider using `netlify dev` from the Netlify CLI
#   which can emulate Identity/Git Gateway locally.
